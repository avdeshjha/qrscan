From outsourced native qr scan developers:

Android Contact plugin should be follow this This plugin has broken due to a change in the way Android handles permissions in 8.0 (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes#o-pri).

Basically: in the past requesting the contact write permission would also give you the contact read permission, but now you have to request both if you want to do both (but it will only ask the user once). The reason the save function was crashing the app was because it was writing the contact and then trying to read it back when it only had the write permission.

I've forked the repository and updated the ContactManager.java file to work with Android 8.0: https://github.com/duncan-c/cordova-plugin-contacts/blob/master/src/android/ContactManager.java

You can simply overwrite your ContactManager.java file in the plugins/cordova-plugin-contacts/src/android directory and then force ionic to recompile the plugin by removing and then re-adding the android platform:

    ionic platform rm android

    ionic platform add android
