DESTRUCTIVE: 
	This will delete the resources folder, replacing it with a copy of either resources_sfa or resources_redeem
	Obviously, it also applies changes to various config files

Usage: (running this script is DESTRUCTIVE, be careful)
	from command line:
		stop ionic serve (if running)
		cd build_manager
		./build_osx (or) ./build.exe
		enter desired json settings file (found adjacent to binary)
			ex: sfa-dev.json
		hit enter
		restart ionic serve
		
Management:
	modify or create <setting>.json (ex: sfa-dev.json)
	binaries are hard coded to look for keys in <settings>.json
	if you want to add files or keys to be managable, main.go will need to be updated and binaries recompiled

	to modify binaries, install go (including setting environment variables)
	run "go get github.com/Jeffail" and "go get github.com/otiai10" to download required libraries
	"cd build_manager" if not already there
	run "go build main.go" to create binary for your current system or run with "go run main.go"
